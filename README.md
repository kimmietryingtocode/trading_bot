# Machine Learning Enhanced Trading Bot

This repository contains a trading bot that leverages machine learning for enhanced decision-making. The bot utilizes technical indicators like moving averages and Average True Range (ATR), as well as sentiment analysis from **FinBERT** to inform buy/sell decisions. The strategy is built using the **Lumibot** framework and trades using the **Alpaca** API.

## Features

- **Sentiment Analysis with FinBERT**: Analyzes financial news related to a specific asset to gauge market sentiment.
- **Automated Trading**: Uses technical indicators and sentiment data to automatically execute trades.
- **ATR-Based Risk Management**: Adjusts the amount of cash at risk based on the asset's volatility.
- **Moving Average Crossovers**: Identifies buy/sell signals using short and long moving averages.
- **Bracket Orders**: Places bracket orders with both take-profit and stop-loss targets to manage risk.

## Tech Stack

- **Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - `transformers` (for FinBERT sentiment analysis)
  - `torch` (for handling machine learning models)
  - `lumibot` (for strategy execution and backtesting)
  - `alpaca-trade-api` (for interacting with Alpaca API)
  - `ccxt` (for multi-exchange support)
  - `numpy`, `pandas` (for data handling)
- **API**:
  - Alpaca API (for real-time trading)
  - YahooDataBackTesting (for historical data during backtesting)
  
## Next Steps
  ### 1. Refine Sentiment Analysis with FinBERT
- **Sentiment Weighting**: Use sentiment probability scores to scale position sizes or risk allocation based on confidence in the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral).
- **Real-Time Sentiment**: Incorporate real-time sentiment tracking by utilizing a streaming API to gather financial news or social media data in real time.

### 2. Dynamic Position Sizing
- **ATR-Based Risk Management**: Improve position sizing using **ATR (Average True Range)** to dynamically adjust how much of your capital is at risk based on the current volatility of the asset.

### 3. Diversify Strategy
- **Multi-Asset Trading**: Enable the bot to trade multiple asset classes like stocks, ETFs, cryptocurrencies, and commodities to diversify risk and opportunities across markets.

### 4. Risk Management Enhancements
- **Stop-Loss/Take-Profit Adjustments**: Use dynamic stop-loss and take-profit levels based on market volatility (ATR) to better manage risk in both high and low volatility environments.

### 5. Multi-Strategy Implementation
- **Multiple Trading Strategies**: Implement different trading strategies like momentum, mean reversion, and breakout trading. Allow the bot to switch between strategies based on market conditions.

### 6. Machine Learning Model Enhancements
- **Advanced Models**: Integrate more advanced machine learning models, such as **Random Forests** or **Gradient Boosting**, to improve prediction accuracy and trading decisions.

### 7. Backtesting Improvements
- **Longer Time Horizons**: Backtest the botâ€™s performance over extended time frames and across various market conditions (bull and bear markets) to ensure robustness and adaptability.

### 8. Real-Time Monitoring and Alerts
- **Performance Dashboard**: Create a real-time performance monitoring dashboard to track metrics like daily P/L, win rate, and risk exposure. Add alert systems for key events like trade execution or drawdown limits.

### 9. Portfolio Optimization
- **Dynamic Portfolio Rebalancing**: Introduce techniques like **Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)** to dynamically rebalance the portfolio and optimize risk vs. reward across multiple assets.

### 10. Paper Trading and Walk-Forward Optimization
- **Paper Trading Mode**: Implement a **paper trading mode** for testing the bot in a simulated environment. Allow easy switching between live trading and paper trading to test new strategies safely.
